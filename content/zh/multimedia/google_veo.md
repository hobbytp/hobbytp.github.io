## case 1 微缩北京天安门

```text
Create a Miniature Landscape-style Animation of Beijing's Tiananmen Square. Start with a scene of an ancient Chinese scroll map made of aged, yellowed rice paper (宣纸). On the map, the central axis of Beijing is clearly marked with a crimson imperial seal stamp (朱砂印章). The marked area clearly delineates the city's grid layout, with distinct details of the paper's fiber texture, traditional ink wash marks (水墨痕迹), and classical Chinese calligraphy annotations. Subsequently, a series of iconic Chinese buildings—including the Tiananmen Gate with its crimson walls and golden-glazed tile roof, the Great Hall of the People with its massive colonnades, the symmetrical National Museum of China, and the central Monument to the People's Heroes—emerge one by one from the marked area on the scroll map, as if growing from the earth. The Tiananmen Gate simulates growth by rising from its white marble base, with the upturned eaves and roof tiles appearing in sequence, and finally, the national emblem materializes above the central gate. The Monument to the People's Heroes extends upward section by section from its base. Next, the vast square area in front of Tiananmen Gate slowly "fills in" and takes shape with the texture of grey paving stones. Chang'an Avenue is drawn across the front, and miniature classic Red Flag limousines (红旗轿车) and city buses appear, moving slowly along the road. On either side of the square and along Chang'an Avenue, sturdy pine and cypress trees, along with rows of ginkgo trees, grow in sequence from the paper texture. In the background, the vast sea of the Forbidden City's golden-tiled roofs ripples into existence behind Tiananmen Gate, while the sky above transitions into a hazy, golden Beijing sunrise, with stylized auspicious clouds (祥云) spreading like an ink wash painting. Finally, the prominent 3D text "BEIJING" (with a surface texture resembling red lacquer or white jade) grows and takes shape from the base of the Monument to the People's Heroes. Throughout the process, it simulates the dynamic rhythm of solemn construction, creating a 3D-rendered miniature model video that combines the classical charm of an ancient scroll, the solemn grandeur of Chinese architecture, and the unique historical significance of the capital's heart, showcasing the magnificent construction process from a seal on a map to the three-dimensional Tiananmen Square.

创作一幅北京天安门的微缩景观风格动画。开篇呈现一幅以泛黄宣纸制成的中国古代舆图，图中北京中轴线以朱砂印章鲜明标注。标记区域清晰勾勒出城市网格布局，纸张纤维肌理、传统水墨晕染痕迹与中式书法批注细节分明。随后，一系列中国标志性建筑——朱墙金瓦的天安门城楼、巨柱林立的人民大会堂、对称布局的中国国家博物馆以及广场中央的人民英雄纪念碑——从舆图标记处逐一拔地而起。天安门城楼模拟生长过程：汉白玉基座率先隆起，层叠飞檐与琉璃瓦依次显现，最终国徽在正中门洞上方凝结成型；人民英雄纪念碑自底座逐段向高空延展。接着，天安门前辽阔的广场区域以灰白色铺路石质感缓慢"填充"成形，长安街横贯前方，微型经典红旗轿车与公交车缓缓驶过。广场两侧与长安街沿线，苍劲松柏与成排银杏树自纸纹肌理中次第生长。背景处，天安门后方浮现紫禁城金色琉璃瓦的连绵海浪，天际则渐变为朦胧鎏金的北京朝霞，祥云图案如水墨般晕染铺展。最终，醒目的立体字"BEIJING"（表面呈现红漆或白玉质感）从人民英雄纪念碑基座处生长定型。全程模拟庄重建设的动态韵律，形成一部融合古卷轴韵味、中式建筑仪轨与首都核心区独特历史意义的3D渲染微缩模型视频，展现从地图印章到立体天安门的壮阔建造历程。

## case 2：罗马城

```
Create a Miniature Landscape-style Animation of Rome's Urban Growth.Start with an unfolded map scene of Rome, where the map texture is clearly visible. Subsequently, groups of Italian ancient buildings-characterized by stone arches, red-tiled roofs, and accompanied by the iconic Colosse- um-emerge one by one from their corresponding positions on the map like the growth of all things, gradually forming the complete main structure of the buildings. Next, the Tiber River slowly takes shape and flows along the river course outline on the map, with vintage gondola-style boats appear- ing on the water surface. Olive trees and cypresses along the riverbank grow in sequence following the green space texture on the map, while the hazy view of the Pantheon in the background spreads simultaneously like an ink wash. Finally, the prominent 3D text "ROMA" grows and takes shape from the area beside the Colosseum on the map. Throughout the process, it simulates the dynamic rhythm of natural growth, creating a 3D-rendered miniature model textured video that embodies a classical, profound, and rich Italian style, showcasing the wonderful construction process from a 2D map to a 3D city.

## case 3：悉尼城

```
Create a Sydney City Growth Animation in Miniature Landscape Style. The animation starts with a scene of an old, yellowed world map with curled edges. The Sydney area is clearly marked with red marker dots on the map, featuring distinct paper textures and retro ink marks. Subsequently, Australian-style build- ings-including light-colored waterfront houses, metal-roofed structures, and the iconic Sydney Opera House-"emerge" one by one from the Sydney marker dots on the map like living things growing, gradually forming complete building structures. Next, Port Jackson slowly "fills and takes shape" along the bay outline of the marked area on the map, with sightseeing yachts "appearing" on the water surface. On the shore, eu- calyptus and palm trees "grow" one after another along the green space texture of the Sydney area on the map, while the hazy background view of the Harbour Bridge gradually spreads out like ink-wash. Finally, the prominent 3D text "SYDNEY" "grows and takes shape" from the Opera House area near the Sydney marker dots on the map. Throughout the process, it simulates the dynamic rhythm of natural growth, creating a 3D-rendered miniature model video that combines retro texture and coastal charm, showcasing the wonder- ful construction process from a marked spot on the world map to a three-dimensional Sydney.

## 等距3D动画案例

```
Isometric 3D animation, showcasing a dazzling and vibrant miniature neon cityscape style, depicting the iconic 3D isometric view of Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour at nightfall. Set on a rounded rectangular base, the scene features a harmonious blend of skyscrapers, mountain landscapes, and local urban charm. The sequence begins with the Star Ferry pier and clock tower, followed by the Peak Tower atop Victoria Peak, and the glass-curtain-walled architectural clusters of Central, including the IFC and Bank of China Tower. Finally, the neon-lit street market of Sham Shui Po and the colorful buildings of Choi Hung Estate unfold in the corners of the model. As the buildings rise, they burst with neon pulse lighting effects accompanied by brief electronic sound effects. The glass facades reflect the dazzling laser show over Victoria Harbour. The harbor waters feature the Star Ferry and the traditional junk boat "Aqua Luna" gliding slowly. Surrounding the base are diner booths, tram stop signs, egg waffle stalls (with steam effects), and neon signs (labeled in traditional Chinese characters). Beyond the base lies the shimmering Victoria Harbour, with cargo ships and helicopters dynamically traversing the scene. Finally, the three-dimensional traditional Chinese characters "HONG KONG" in neon lighting effects flicker in from the right and come to a steady hover beside the model of Two International Finance Centre.
